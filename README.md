# POKEDEX
This project was developed with the intent to practice ReactJS and API consumption. The API used was the PokéAPI. In the home page, the user can see all the Pokémons, select them to get more information about their strengths and moves, and add them to their Pokédex. In the Pokédex page, the user can still see the Pokémon's details and remove them from their Pokédex. On the top of the page, it is possible to select 2 Pokémons from the Pokédex to battle against each other.
